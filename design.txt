Missile and Mine create an Explosion when in proximity of target or expiring.

Bullet and Explosion have optional image, optional color.

Particular instances of Decoy include a list of weapons attracted by the instance.

BeamCurved may be a little too ambitious. Anything in contact with the curve must receive damage.
