Missile and Mine create an Explosion when in proximity of target or expiring.

Bullet and Explosion have optional image, optional color.

Particular instances of Decoy include a list of weapons attracted by the instance.

BeamCurved may be a little too ambitious. Anything in contact with the curve must receive damage.

It may be better to not have Beam objects and simply check when the weapon is firing if it is hitting anything. (Instead of having a Beam object and a ProjectorBeam weapon object, just use a ProjectorBeam object.)

BeamRepair is simply a Beam weapon with negative damage. Will need to make sure structInteg of repaired ships does not go above their max structInteg.
