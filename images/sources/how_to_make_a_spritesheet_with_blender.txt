How to put a 2d image on a plane in Blender:

Delete the default cube object
Add a new mesh - a plane
Add material to the plane
Add texture to the material
Unwrap if necessary (hover over plane and press u)
Position texture in uv map (use g to grab and left click to confirm)
Position camera (use view > camera, view > navigation > walk, and view > navigation > fly)
Turn on transparency on the material and change alpha to 0
Turn on alpha under texture > influence > diffuse
Turn on color under texture > influence > specular
Change lamp type from point to sun, to get a bright end result
View > top before rotating
Add key frames and rotate the plane by pressing r, typing the number of degrees to rotate, and pressing enter
Recommend using 25 frames and 5 key frames, pointing the spaceship up (key frame 1), left (7), down (13), right (19), and up (25) in the key frames
Change interpolation to linear on dope sheet (press t and select)
Change background to transparent under scene (the little camera) > Shading > Alpha
Render animation to png files
Retrieve them from /tmp
Delete the last image, 0025.png - it was just a guide
Concatenate them with convert * +append result.png (with imagemagick)
